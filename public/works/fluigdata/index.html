	<h3>About Fluig Data</h3>

	<p>Enterprises need clean data to generate and track business metrics, but many of them tend to have business units that generate and store partial information of the same entity in siloed systems, leading to duplicate and inconsistent information. Fluig Data addresses this by centralizing all information about an entity into a Data Model, then applying rules to reject, duplicate and transform incoming data to produce a reliable single source of truth which is then used to generate insights.</p>

	<p>Building a product is an extremely involved process with many levels of UI, flows, states and interactions. Different prototyping tools help communicate details of a variety of flows and interactions to stakeholders.</p>

<div class="caption">Prototyping on the web provides several benefits. You benefit from the HTML layout behavior, are able to reuse existing styles from the application, and can be extremely flexible by using Javascript frameworks and libraries like Angular and Greensock (used in this prototype).</div>

	<h3>Involvement</h3>

	<p>As part of a team of about 15, and as one of two UX designers, I have been broadly involved in the development of Fluig Data from the beginning and in various capacities. My contributions have been mostly in the area of designing the user interface, flows and interactions, conducting interviews and usability studies, but I have touched on several other areas as well.</p>

	<p>Some highlights:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I initiated and conducted the first user research activities in the company, including interviews and usability studies.</li>
		<li>Before we had a dedicated UI engineer, I built the UI on top of our framework (Angular Material at that time) and later built custom components to better flows specific to our product.</li>
		<li>After the release of Invision Craft's nested symbols, I re-created the UI components used in the product and centralized them using Invision Library to sync them across multiple documents and make them accessible to the team.</li>
		<li>I defined a standard for task specifications so that the team can have a shared understanding of the information they needed before they began working on a task.</li>
		<li>I convinced the team to switch over to Trello from JIRA because I wanted to make it easier and faster to create and get information about development stories.</li>
		<li>For a significant portion of the development, I conducted sprint planning, retrospectives and prioritized stories. Having visbility over user needs and business goals helped guide many of my decisions.</li>
	</ul>

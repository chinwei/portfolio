<span class="byline">Context Aware Diary</span></p>

<p>Moment is an attempt to capture small pieces of information during informal interactions. Many kinds of information, like learning something interesting during a coffee meeting with a colleague not easily captured.</p>

<p>What if capturing a thought was as simple as sending a message to yourself, and what if it was as easy to associate that note with people, location and documents?</p>

<p>The idea for Moment came about when I realized how cumbersome it was to have to name each note in apps like Evernote or Google Docs.</p>

<p>Another drawback of organizing notes around documents was that it made it harder to link between them.</p>

<p>Reminders but not todos, no due date</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Had meeting with A and B today, decided to go with X</p></li>

<li><p>X mentioned that his boss prefers this, should explore in that direction</p></li>

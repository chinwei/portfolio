<h3 id="improve-patient-engagement">Improve patient engagement</h3>

<p>As a culmination of Carnegie Mellon’s Master’s of HCI program, this 8-month project was sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to look into a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>Over the course of the project, we conducted user research, ideated, refined and iterated our designs until we arrived at a high fidelity solution that was validated by our users.</p>

<p>During the research phase of the project, we studied patient lives, behavior change strategies, spoke with clinicians, and developed key insights which informed our ideas toward this goal.</p>

<p>Following that, we validated our ideas with our users, by getting them to interact with prototypes of increasing fidelity. At the end of the prototyping phase, we built a mobile app prototype using PhoneGap and Cordova that could track the location of our users.</p>

<h3 id="about-upmc">About UPMC</h3>

<p>The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is an integrated global non-profit health enterprise that has more than 62,000 employees, 22 hospitals, and a 2.2 million-member health insurance division. They are also ranked one of top ten hospitals in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="improve-patient-engagement">Improve patient engagement</h3>

<p>As a culmination of Carnegie Mellon’s Master’s of HCI program, this 8-month project was sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to look into a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>Over the course of the project, we conducted user research, design, and development of a high fidelity technology solution.</p>

<p>We studied patient lives, behavior change strategies, spoke with clinicians, and developed key insights and visions toward this goal. Our numerous design visions were refined to one idea, which we developed into a mobile app prototype and concept video.</p>

<p>As the user experience lead, I played a key role in designing and building the various prototypes.</p>

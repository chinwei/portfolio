	<p>
		A poster illustrating one of the possible ways to make the microwave controls more usable. Considering they are one of the most ubiquitous kitchen appliances around, people still have to wrestle with various buttons just to get it to heat up their food. I came up with a simpler alternative for those who doesn't want to go through the user manual in order to get the microwave to reheat their food.

	<h2>The Origin of the Avant-Garde in America</h2>
	<div class="divider"></div>
	<img src="portfolio/image/ixd/poster.jpg" alt="">
	<p>
		A poster designed for a ficticious event. I used monochromatic colors for the text and imagery and used a subdued shade of green to allow the primary content to have sufficient contrast. To deal with the large amount of text, I used the event and location as a point of entry and relied heavily on a grid to maintain consistency and visual balance.

	<p>A mockup of a ficticious magazine targetted at people who travel to do volunteer work. The magazine relies heavily on close up photographs of people to bring out the intensity of emotional impact of volunteer work. The accompanying mood board assembled early in the project served as a guide to how the magazine should feel in the final product.</p>

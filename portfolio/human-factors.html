		The CMU Police Department runs an evening Escort Service which uses buses to transport students safely to the intersections nearest their residences if they live within 1.5 miles of campus. The drivers of these buses do not run set routes, but base their routes on the destinations of the students onboard.
	</p>

	<p>The combination of low-light driving and high cognitive load of the route planning task is challenging and poses a safety risk. I worked in a team of 3 students to address some of the issues we found, and we proposed a tablet app which attempts to minimize the memory workload of the drivers during their route by providing relevant timely information with minimal distraction.

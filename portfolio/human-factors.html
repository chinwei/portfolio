		<h4>Overview</h4>
		
		<img src="portfolio/image/human-factors/cheat-sheet.jpg" alt="">

		<p>The CMU Police Department runs an evening Escort Service. Buses transport students safely to their places of residence. The drivers of these buses base their driving routes on the destinations of the passengers. The combination of low-light driving and high cognitive load of the route planning task is challenging and poses a safety risk. </p>
		
		<h4>Interviews And Observations</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/human-factors/route.jpg" alt="">
		<p>To approach this problem we took the Escort buses for the duration of a route and observed the challenges they encountered during each route. Following that, we conducted retrospective interviews and asked the drivers to describe the steps they take to perform certain tasks.</p>
		
		<h4>Literature Review</h4>
		
		<p>We did a literature review on journal articles relating to several human factors concepts including cognition, memory, perception and displays.</p>
		
		<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>

		<p>Informed by the interviews and literature reviews, we brainstormed for possible solutions and converged to two solutions. The first is a tablet app which minimizes the memory workload of the drivers during their route by providing relevant timely information with minimal distraction. The second is a redesign of the ‘cheat sheet’ used by the drivers as a memory aid as they are driving. The goal of the redesign is to address visibility issues during night-time driving, minimize the distraction of performing such a task.</p>

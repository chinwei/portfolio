	<h3>Role: Frontend Development, Picture Research, Photography Direction</h3>
	<p>
		This website was built as part of mint's rebranding efforts. I worked with a web designer to ideate concepts and solutions for the project. After the static mockup was finalized, I built the website in HTML/SASS/Compass/Javascript, and directed the photography used in the background images for this website.

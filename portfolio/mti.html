	<p>Flitter Bloom is an interactive art project that explores how plants might move in response to human presence. For this project, I was involved primarily in the implementation of the hardware. This project is heavily influenced by Botanicus Interacticus by Disney Research.</p>

	<p>In this project, with the help of 2 other team members, we deconstructed the idea of a whisker as a sensory system and explored one of the forms in which it can be represented. Our final product is a mechanical creature that is controlled by the whiskers situated on the top of its head. Using a photoresistor, we made the creature fall by spinning around when it is 'blindfolded'.</p>

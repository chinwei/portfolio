		<p>The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is an integrated global nonprofit health enterprise that has more than 62,000 employees, 22 hospitals, and a 2.2 million-member health insurance division.</p>

		<p>As part of the CMU MHCI Capstone Project, our team is working with UPMC to explore ways for patients to collaborate over their own health data with their clinicians, and following that, to design a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p>

		<p>During our initial research, we conducted a series of guerrilla interviews, literature review and competitive analysis to gain an overview of the healthcare landscape and to inform more formal studies.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<h4>Hunt Statement</h4>
			<p>Motivating hypertension patients to positive lifestyle change by improving the collaboration with their clinician</p>

		<p>Subsequently, we recruited a number of participants and arranged interviews. Using the information gathered in the interviews, we held story sharing sessions to keep the team updated on what each member had found in the field. We then used the insights to build an affinity diagram.</p>

		<p>In order to validate some of our findings, and to dig deeper into some of the questions we had, we conducted a one week long diary study on some of the participants we interviewed, and we went through the diary studies with participants to explore the surrounding context. For some of these participants, we visited their place of residence to better understand more about how they live their lives.</p>

		<p>We are currently synthesizing the research data and will create a number of visions that are informed by our research. During summer, we will be building a prototype, conducting user tests and iterating and we look forward to delivering a feasible and meaningful solution.</p>

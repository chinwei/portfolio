		<h4>Overview</h4>
		
		<p>The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is an integrated global non-profit health enterprise that has more than 62,000 employees, 22 hospitals, and a 2.2 million-member health insurance division.</p>
		<p>As part of the CMU MHCI Capstone Project, our team is working with UPMC to explore ways for patients to collaborate over their own health data with their clinicians, and to design a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p>
		<p>During our initial research, we conducted a series of guerrilla interviews, literature review and competitive analysis to gain an overview of the healthcare landscape and to inform more formal studies.</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Hunt Statement</h4>
			
			<p>Motivating hypertension patients to positive lifestyle change by improving the collaboration with their clinician.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<h4>Semi-structured Interviews</h4>
		
		<p>After gaining an initial understanding of the healthcare landscape, we conducted a number of more focused interviews with patients and clinicians that are more in line with our objectives. These interviews were more structured and helped us deepen our understanding in the area of interest.</p>
		
		<h4>Story Sharing</h4>

		<p>Using the information gathered in the interviews, we held story sharing sessions to keep the team updated on what each member had found in the field. We then used the insights to build an affinity diagram to see the recurring themes and overarching issues. </p>
		
		<h4>Diary Studies And House Visits</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/upmc/diaries.jpg" alt="">
		<p>In order to validate some of our findings, and to dig deeper into some of the questions we had, we conducted a one week long diary study on some of the participants we interviewed. To explore the surrounding context, we went through the diary studies with participants. For some of these participants, we made on-site visits to see first-hand the environment they lived in.</p>
		
		<h4>Data Consolidation</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/upmc/affinity.jpg" alt="">
		<p>We are currently synthesizing the research data and will create a number of visions that are informed by our research. During summer, we will build a prototype, conduct user tests and iterate. We expect to deliver a feasible and meaningful solution.</p>

			<p>As part of the CMU MHCI Capstone Project, our team is working with UPMC to explore ways for patients to collaborate over their own health data with their clinicians, and following that, to design a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p>

			<p>As the User Experience Design Lead, I design communication materials to help inform the client and the course. During the design phase, I will be involved in the design of the prototype.</p>

			After the kick off meeting with our client, we conducted a series of guerrilla interviews, literature review and competitive analysis to gain an overview of the health care landscape and used we found to inform more formal studies that were conducted subsequently.

			<h4>Hunt Statement</h4>
			<p>Motivating hypertension patients to positive lifestyle change by improving the collaboration with their clinician</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			After the initial phase of research, we redefined our focus and revised hunt statement to better reflect our new direction. In this new research phase, we recruited and interviewed participants.

			After the interviews, we had story sharing sessions, where we shared our notes and experiences, and other members would write down insights on post its.

			Over the next few weeks, we worked on building our affinity diagram. As recurring themes emerged, we modified our interview questions to probe areas that seem promising.

		<p>In order to validate some of our findings, and to find out whether there was anything we missed during the interviews, we conducted a one week long diary study on some of the participants we interviewed.</p>

		<p>After collecting the diaries, we talked with the participants about what they wrote in the diary.</p>

		<p>We also conducted a number of house visits to better understand the way these people live their lives.</p>

		<p>We are currently synthesizing the research data and with that done, we will create a number of visions that are informed by our research. During summer, we will be building a prototype, conducting user tests and iterating and we look forward to delivering a feasible and meaningful solution.</p>

		<h4>Overview</h4>
		
		<p>Trace is a mobile app that allows teenagers to rediscover shared memories, and where they happened. A summary of our process and </p>
		
		<h4>Background Research</h4>

		<p>Teens spend 7 hours on their smartphones each day, and photo sharing is a big part of their lives. Hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded to social networks each day. Large scale acquisitions like Instagram and more recently, the 19 billion dollars purchase of Whatsapp by Facebook highlighted the huge opportunity behind simple sharing of media and text messages.</p>
		
		<h4>Guerilla Interviews</h4>
		
		<p>We interviewed teenagers to find out how they interacted with their virtual possessions such as photos and music and found that photos in general hold special meaning to them. Most of them felt that if they were to lose their phones, photos would be what they would miss the most. We also found that while teenagers enjoy taking pictures and posting to social networks, they seldom look back at them. </p>
		
		<h4>Opportunity</h4>
		
		<p>Teenagers like sharing silly photos among close friends, and they love surprises. What if we can give them a reason to look back on their old photos, and make it enjoyable?</p>
		
		<h4>About Trace</h4>

		<p>Trace allows people to take photos of memorable events, and leave that as a Trace. When any of the people tagged re-visit the location, each of them will be notified that they have picked up the Trace. They then can comment and reminisce about the event with their friends for a duration before the Trace expires.</p>
		
		<h4>Persona And Scenario</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/trace/persona.jpg" alt="">
		
		<p>To come up with this concept, we created a persona and a scenario to better help us identify with our target audience and how they might use the app. These also made it easier to communicate our users to the audience.</p>
		
		<h4>Dashboard Design</h4>

		<p>We also created a dashboard to help us monitor the usage patterns of the app, which could help us uncover interesting opportunities. It also acts as a health monitor. For example, if usage varies a lot within a short period of time or if we see something that is not planned for, we could act on it.</p>

		<p class="lead">I worked in a team of four students to investigate teenager's attachment to virtual possessions, explored product opportunities and brainstormed various ways to address them. For this project, I developed the wireframes, hi-fi mockups as well as presentation slides for the pitch.</p>

		<h4>Overview</h4>
		
		<p>For our mobile app design project, We chose to explore teenagersâ€™ attachment to virtual possessions, such as photos, videos and text messaging. Over a course of two weeks, we conducted a number of guerrilla interviews and read relevant literature to understand this unfamiliar domain. </p>

		<p>In our data, we found that teenagers tend to hoard photos taken on their mobile phones, but do not often look back at them, and that conversation is usually more for entertainment rather than information. They also enjoy being surprised.</p>

		<p>After several hours of brainstorming, we came up with the idea for Trace. Trace is a mobile app that allow teenagers to rediscover their memories where they happened. When teenagers go for a holiday with their friends or family, they are able to leave a Trace. The next time they visit the place, the app would display the photos taken at the location as well as the people they were with. </p>

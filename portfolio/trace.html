		<p>In our Interaction Design Studio Class, our assignment is to pitch an idea for a mobile app.</p>

		<img src="portfolio/image/trace/numbers.jpg" alt="">

		<p>Teens spend 7 hours on their smartphones each day, and photo sharing is a big part of their lives. Hundreds of millions of photos are uploaded to social networks each day. At the same time, large scale acquisitions like Instagram and more recently, the 19 billion purchase of Whatsapp by Facebook highlighted the huge opportunity behind simply sharing media and text messages.</p> 

		<p>For our background research, we talked to teenagers to find out how they interacted with their virtual possessions, such as photos and music, and found that photos in general hold special meaning to them. Most of them felt that if they were to lose their phones, photos would be what they would miss the most.</p>

		<p>We also found that while teenagers enjoy taking pictures and posting to social networks, they seldom look back at them. At the same time, they like sharing silly photos among close friends, and they love surprises. What if we can give them a reason to look back on their old photos, and make it enjoyable?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
			<p>Trace is a mobile app that allows teenagers to rediscovered shared memories, where they happened.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Trace allows people to take photos of memorable events, for example while on a trip, and leave that as a Trace. When any of the people tagged visit the location a few months later, each of them will be notified that they have picked up the Trace, after which they can comment and reminisce about the event with their friends for a duration, before the Trace expires.</p> 

		<img src="portfolio/image/trace/persona.jpg" alt="">

		<p>To come up with this concept, we created a persona and a scenario to better help us identify with our target audience and how they might use the app. These also made it easier to communicate our users to the audience.</p>

		<p>At the same time, we made a dashboard that shows the important information regarding the usage of the app, as well as a dashboard persona.</p>

		<p>Subsequently we created a navigational map and wireframes to illustrate how the app would work in practise.</p>

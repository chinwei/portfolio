			<p>
				From our background research, we found that teens spend a lot of time consuming media, and volume of photos uploaded to social networks present an opportunity
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We conducted a number of guerilla interviews with teenagers in order to better understand how they value their virtual possessions on their phone and we found that, photos mean a lot to them. Most of them said that if they lost their phones, photos would be the thing they miss the most.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also found that while teenagers enjoy taking pictures and posting to social networks, they seldom look back at them. At the same time, they like sharing silly photos among close friends. What if we can give them a reason to look back on their old photos, and make it enjoyable?

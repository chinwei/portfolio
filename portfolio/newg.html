			<h4 class="boxed">Project</h4>
			<p>We are working with the New Economy Working Group to explore ways to help event planners in the New Economy by creating a tool to identifying event conflicts.</p>
			<p>We are currently in the research phase of the project and are synthesizing our research findings obtained from our interviews, literature reviews and competitive analysis. Over the next few weeks, we will create several visions that addresses the problem, create and user test our prototypes in summer.</p>

			<h4 class="boxed">Involvement</h4>

			<p>As the Design Lead, I design communication materials to help inform the client and the course. During the design phase, I will be involved in the design of the prototype.</p>

			<p>Thomas Merton Center is an non-profit grassroots organization in Pittsburgh whose mission is to educate, raise awareness and to ask the moral questions that surround issues of social justice, poverty, workers' rights, racial discrimination, environmental and economic justice, peace and nonviolence.</p>

			<p>
				The goal of this project is to understand the goals and challenges of event planners in the New Economy and create an interactive tool to facilitate communication and empower the New Economy with more informed decision-making.

			<p>In order to acquaint ourselves with the domain, we did a number of literature reviews, a competitive analysis of other tools within the event planning and social media space. We also interviewed a number of event planners as well as some people who regularly attended New Economy events.</p>

			<p>In order to understand how events were planned within the organization, we attended a monthly planning meeting where they were planning an upcoming event.</p>

				From the interview notes, we wrote each insight on a piece of post it and created an affinity diagram.

				We conducted 2 visioning workshops with the clients and together we came up with over 40 solutions, of which we consolidated and short listed 3.

			<p>
				We made a low-fi wireframe for a solution that we thought was most feasible and useful to the event planners.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, we will be iterating on our design and finally deliver a working prototype.

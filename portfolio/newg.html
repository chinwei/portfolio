				As the design lead for this project, I came with up with the concept and visual identity for the project. I also generated high-fidelity user interface mockups and specifications for our proposed solution for implementation. I was also deeply involved in the research, prototyping and iterative process.

		<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

		<p>The Thomas Merton Center is a non-profit grassroots organization in Pittsburgh whose mission is to educate, raise awareness, and to ask the moral questions that surround issues of social justice, poverty, workers' rights, racial discrimination, environmental and economic justice, peace and nonviolence.</p>

		<h4>Domain Analysis</h4>
		
		<p>We gathered data from a variety of sources including literature reviews, competitive analysis, interviews and observations to get an in-depth understanding of the domain and the challenges our target users were facing.</p>
		
		<h4>Interviews and Observations</h4>
		
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/interview.jpg" alt="">

		<p>
			We talked to 11 event attendees and planners using a guided storytelling technique and observed some event planners in the process of planning an event.
		</p>
		
		<h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/competitive-analysis.jpg" alt="">
		
		<p>The goal of our competitive analysis is to explore the tools that are part of an event planning workflow, such as calendars, social media networks and event planning websites to seek out opportunities for our solution.</p>
		
		<h4>Affinity Diagramming</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/affinity-2.jpg" alt="">
		<p>After gathering a pool of data from our research, we constructed an affinity diagram by grouping our findings into related themes, and used them to generate higher level insights.</p>

		<h4>Persona</h4>
		
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/persona.jpg" alt="">

		<p>
			From the key findings we gathered during data synthesis, we identified a target user that would benefit the most from our solution, and from there we developed a persona that we would focus our solution around.

		<h4>VISIONING</h4>
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/visioning.jpg" alt="">
		<p>We conducted a visioning session with our client where we brainstormed over forty solutions. We then refined them and decided to focus on three of them.</p>

		<h4>Speed Dating</h4>
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/storyboard.jpg" alt="">
		
		<p>We created created storyboards illustrating our solutions and speed dated them with our target users, where we presented our storyboards and gathered responses for each of them.</p>

		<h4>Prototyping Process</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/iteration-3.jpg" alt="">
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/iteration-4.jpg" alt="">

		<p>Over a three month period, we created several iterations of our prototype. We used Balsamiq for our lo-fi prototype and after a few rounds of user testing, we tested with high fidelity mockups built with Sketch. After the look and feel was finalized, we coded an interactive prototype in HTML/CSS/Javascript and conducted further tests on it.</p>

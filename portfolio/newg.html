			<p>Thomas Merton Center is an non-profit grassroots organization in Pittsburgh whose mission is to educate, raise awareness and to ask the moral questions that surround issues of social justice, poverty, workers' rights, racial discrimination, environmental and economic justice, peace and nonviolence.</p>

			<p>The goal of this project is to understand the goals and challenges of event planners in the New Economy and create an interactive tool to facilitate communication and empower the New Economy with more informed decision-making.</p>

			<p>In order to acquaint ourselves with the domain, we did a number of literature reviews, a competitive analysis of other tools within the event planning and social media space. We also interviewed a number of New Economy event planners as well as event attendees. In order to understand how events were planned within the organization, we attended a monthly planning meeting in the Thomas Merton Center.</p>

			<p>After gathering a pool of data from our research, we constructed an affinity diagram to get a high level view of the issues faced by both event planners as well as event attendees, and conducted 2 visioning workshops where we worked with our client to brainstorm and come up with over forty solutions, of which we shortlisted three, based on their feasibility and impact.</p>

			<p>Based on the visions, we are currently creating concepts that addresses the needs validated by our research, and will be performing multiple rounds of iteration followed by development of a working prototype.</p>

		<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
		
		<p>The Thomas Merton Center is a non-profit grassroots organization in Pittsburgh whose mission is to educate, raise awareness, and to ask the moral questions that surround issues of social justice, poverty, workers' rights, racial discrimination, environmental and economic justice, peace and nonviolence.</p>
		<p>The goal of this project is to understand the goals and challenges of event planners in the New Economy and create an interactive tool to facilitate communication and empower the New Economy with more informed decision-making.</p>
		
		<h4>LITERATURE REVIEW</h4>
		
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/lit-review.jpg" alt="">

		<p>We delved into journal articles related to the non-profit event planning space. This gave us an overview of the existing research and a broader understanding in this domain.</p>
		
		<h4>INTERVIEWS and Observations</h4>
		
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/interview.jpg" alt="">

		<p>To acquire insights on the challenges behind event planning, we interviewed a number of event planners and event attendees over a broad age and experience range. This helped us understand how differently each individual operated and the challenges they had to deal with on a regular basis. To observe everyoneâ€™s involvement in the meeting, we observed New Economy members plan for upcoming meetings in the Thomas Merton Center.</p>
		
		<h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>

		<p>The goal of our competitive analysis is to explore the tools that are part of an event planning workflow, such as calendars, social media networks and event planning websites to seek out opportunities for our solution.</p>
		
		<h4>Affinity Diagramming</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/affinity-2.jpg" alt="">
		<p>After gathering a pool of data from our research, we constructed an affinity diagram to get a sense of the recurring issues uncovered during our research which can be used to support our solution.</p>
		
		<h4>VISIONING</h4>
		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/visioning.jpg" alt="">
		<p>We engaged our client in visioning workshops where we worked together to brainstorm and come up with over forty solutions. Subsequently, we shortlisted three which we both felt were most feasible and impactful.</p>
		
		<h4>Next Steps</h4>

		<img src="portfolio/image/newg/wireframe-sketch.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Over the next few weeks, we will be creating concepts of our solutions and conducting speed dating sessions with them. Following that, we will create wireframes which will undergo several rounds of iterations until a working prototype is developed.</p>

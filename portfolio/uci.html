				I submitted an entry to a UX design competition organized by University of California Irvine, as part of a crowd sourcing study. Over three days, I conducted a competitive analysis, a number of sketches, executed and iterated on a high-fidelity mockup.

			<h4>Overview</h4>

			<p>
				For the competition, participants were to design a traffic flow simulation program for Civil Engineering students to experiment with different traffic signal timing schemes. The program had to address several broad requirements, such as being able vary traffic density on a single road and also to accommodate left-hand turns on traffic lights. It also had to facilitate experimentation.
			</p>
		
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			
			<p>
				Usually when I start on a project, especially one in an unfamiliar domain, I would do a quick review of competing products to get a brief understanding of the design patterns, design language used in this domain. For this competition my exploration revolved around traffic flow simulations, games and mapping software like Google Maps.

			<p>
				During my brief exploration, I found many traffic flow simulation tools to be complex, but also highly functional with creating realistic traffic flow models. However, due to this complexity, they also tend to have a steep learning curve. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Mapping tools such as Google Maps also face some of these challenges. The software visualizes real-world data, which is inherently complex and abstracts it to a level where it is both useful and quickly parsed by the mainstream population. 
			</p>

			<h4>Considering use cases</h4>

			<p>
				For the traffic flow simulation program I was designing, I felt that it would be somewhere in between mapping software and current traffic simulation programs in the market. The software would have to faciliate a large variety of interactions, such as building roads of various configurations, modifying the duration of each traffic light, toggling left-hand turn arrows and many others. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition, there had to be immediate feedback on two levels. The first is the feedback on the action initiated, such as the toggling of a state or a duration change and the resulting outcome on the traffic. Another is the macro view of the traffic conditions and comparison with previous actions. Without this, it would be difficult for the software to function as a learning tool.
			</p>

			<h4>Considering visual noise</h4>

			<p>
				Software that have to deal with large amount of input and output of data inherent face a problem of information overload. In dealing with this I try to keep in mind the intention of the software, which is to design a tool for Civil Engineering students that facilitates learning based on experimentation.
			</p>

			<h4>Initial Design</h4>

			<p>The competition takes place in two phases. After the first design round is completed, we were to iterate on our designs after reviewing the entries by the other participants. I started out with several sketches to visualize some of the high level details, then started building the mockup in Sketch.</p>

			<p>
				For my first iteration of the design, I relied heavily on contextual input. For example, clicking on a traffic light display assumed the user wanted to view or modify details about that traffic light. I also designed the interface to be tablet-friendly. One reason for that is that it forced simpler inputs, so that it is beneficial to desktop as well. Another reason is that multitouch interactions on the tablet provide many advantages such as panning, zooming and rotating the map which is more intuitive on the tablet.

			<h4>Changes made in phase 2</h4>

			<p>
				During the second phase of the competition, I made several incremental changes to the interface. One of them was to change the method of selection when selecting a road segment to modify variables traffic density. For my first iteration I proposed using a lasso for the selection, but after that I found that such a method did not facilitate the selection of the road in a single direction. For the second iteration I proposed to use a tracing method instead, which I felt allowed for more granular control with compromising much on usability.

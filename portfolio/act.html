			<p>A mockup of a ficticious magazine targetted at people who travel to do volunteer work. The magazine relies heavily on close up photographs of people to bring out the intensity of emotional impact of volunteer work. The accompanying mood board assembled early in the project served as a guide to how the magazine should feel in the final product.</p>

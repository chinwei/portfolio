		My role in this project was to execute the digital version of the report. I advocated the need to move away from Flash to HTML5 and to leverage the interactive capability of the digital medium to better engage the target audience.

				This project was a continuation of a series of annual reports that were made for the stakeholders of the public library. It was also the first to be built with modern, accessible web technologies like HTML5, which we strongly pitched for.

				Being a government website also meant that it had to be accessible to a wide range of audiences, all viewing it on devices with different capability, while still delivering the visual impact.

			<p>This project was awarded the Davey Awards in 2013.</p>

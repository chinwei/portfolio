	<h3>Role: Frontend Development</h3>	
	
	<p>
		As this was a government project targetted at the general public, it had to be widely accessible across a range of browsers. I worked with a web designer to design and build a solution that was appealing to users on modern systems, but remained functional on older browsers (up to Internet Explorer 7). I built this website on Serve, a Ruby-based backend, using HAML/SASS/Javscript and deployed as a static HTML package.

	<h3>Role: Frontend Development, Picture Research, Photography Direction</h3>
	<p>
		This website was built as part of mint's rebranding efforts. I worked with a web designer to ideate concepts and solutions for the project. After the static mockup was finalized, I built the website in HTML/SASS/Compass/Javascript, and directed the photography used in the background images for this website.

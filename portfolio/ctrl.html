			<p>The microwave oven has always been a source of fascination for me. It is one of the most frequently used kitchen appliance, and for a small number of purposes, but the typical interface is often complex and unwieldy. My goal here was to see how far I can simplify the interaction and while still making it useful for most of the people using it.</p>

			<h4>The Control</h4>
			<p>
				I proposed having a knob as the sole control mechanism. Knobs are common among other kitchen appliances like the traditional oven, and the intention of the knob, especially with the dark circular marking, should be obvious to most users.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although it hasn't been verified formally, microwave ovens appears to be used to reheat food more than any other use cases. In such cases, the time required should mostly be in the 3-5 minute range, with some exceptions. I excluded the controls for power adjustment, because power settings vary from model to model and it is meaningless to the user when there is no appropriate frame of reference.
			</p>

			<p>
				The granularity of between each time stop decreases as the total time set increases. The difference of thirty seconds means much less at 8 minutes compared to at 1 minute.
			</p>

			<h4>The Display</h4>
			<p>
				The only indicator on the microwave oven is the circular led strip around the knob. It serves two purposes: To indicate when the microwave is in operation, and to indicate the time set and approximately how much time is left.
			</p>
			<h4>The Aesthetic</h4>
			<p>
				The metallic finish implies durability and the lack of buttons makes the surface easier to clean due to the lack of bumps and ridges.

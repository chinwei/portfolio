		<h4>Overview</h4>
		
		<p>The microwave oven has always been a source of fascination for me. It is one of the most frequently used kitchen appliance, and for a small number of purposes, but the typical interface is often complex and unwieldy. My goal was to simplify the interaction and while still making it useful for most of the people using it.</p>
		
		<h4>The Control</h4>
		
		<p>I proposed having a knob as the sole control mechanism. Knobs are common among other kitchen appliances like the traditional oven. Hence, the intention of the knob, especially with the dark circular marking on the edge, should be obvious to most users.</p>
		<p>Although it hasn't been verified formally, microwave ovens are most frequently used to reheat food. In such cases, the usage time is mostly in the 3-5 minute range, with some exceptions. I excluded the controls for power adjustment, because power settings vary from model to model and it is meaningless to the user when there is no appropriate frame of reference.</p>
		<p>The granularity of between each time step decreases as the total time set increases. The difference of 30 seconds means much less at 8 minutes compared to at 1 minute, and this design would allow for a smaller extent of turning for most users.</p>
		
		<h4>The Display</h4>
		
		<p>The only indicator on the microwave oven is the circular LED strip around the knob. It serves two purposes: To indicate when the microwave is in operation, and to indicate the time set and approximately how much time is left.</p>
		
		<h4>The Aesthetic</h4>
		
		<p>The metallic finish implies durability and the lack of buttons makes the surface easier to clean due to the lack of bumps and ridges.</p>

    &lt;span class=&#34;title&#34;&gt;Divvy&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;byline&#34;&gt;The fastest way to split bills at the table&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;video class=&#34;mobile&#34; autoplay loop controls poster=&#39;/assets/divvy-poster.jpg&#39;&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/divvy.mp4&#39; media=&#39;(min-device-pixel-ratio:2), (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:2), (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio:2)&#39;&gt; 
	  &lt;!--  &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/splitbill/splitbill.mp4&#39; media=&#39;(max-device-pixel-ratio:1), (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio:1), (max--moz-device-pixel-ratio:1), (-o-max-device-pixel-ratio:1)&#39;&gt;  --&gt;
	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
    Divvy-ing meal bills is much quicker without having to deal with names. Prototype built and recorded with Adobe XD.    
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Divvy is a quick, no frills way of splitting bills with friends at the table. Just enter the price of each item and decide who to split it with. Instead of typing the name of your friends, assign them each an animal for the duration of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It is an idea I an toying with during my free time. It came about when I came across similar situations and thought there should be a quick and straightforward way to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I currently like that the entire flow is contained within one view, and at this point it seems to be efficient for certain cases. At the moment I like the ideas of using animals to reference people. They can be easily made attractive while being neutral and effective as long as they are visually distinct. It could also potentially be fun, given the context, to address your friends using animals. üêîüêºüêôüê≥&lt;/p&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;One issue that should be considered is that currently the flow revolves around itemization, which works well for smaller number of items. For larger bills it would probably be more efficient to start with the total amount and isolate items that are not equally split.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Another point to be looked into is identifying the situations where the host is expected to split the bill equally (or not). In some cases it is obvious, for instance, if a vegetarian participates in a (meat heavy) barbeque, my understanding of social norms tell me that the participants should not expect the vegetarian to pay for the meat. Aside from this, there are many other situations in which it is not as obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing personal project that I am planning to build as I learn Swift. Check back for future iterations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;title&#34;&gt;Pensieve&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;byline&#34;&gt;Write notes and associate them with your contacts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;video class=&#34;mobile&#34; autoplay controls loop poster=&#34;/assets/pensieve-poster.jpg&#34;&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/pensieve.mp4&#39;&gt; 
	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
    A messaging flow should be familiar to many people. Here I am exploring to see whether it makes sense to repurpose the flow to reference people instead. Built using Sketch and Framer.  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;Pensieve is a place where you can write notes and associate them with people. When you take a note, it captures the date and location to help you better recall the ideas that has to do with a context and person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;

	&lt;video controls autoplay loop&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/pensieve-gomix.mp4&#39; media=&#39;(min-device-pixel-ratio:2), (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2), (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio:2), (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio:2)&#39;&gt; 
	  &lt;!--  &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/splitbill/splitbill.mp4&#39; media=&#39;(max-device-pixel-ratio:1), (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio:1), (max--moz-device-pixel-ratio:1), (-o-max-device-pixel-ratio:1)&#39;&gt;  --&gt;
	&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
	    Video prototypes can only get me so far. This prototype allowed me to test out the interaction on my phone. Built the app logic in Gomix, used Twilio for handling SMSes and Firebase for storage.
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Pensieve, you can record pieces of information about during informal interactions and because your notes live on a timeline, it is easy to look back at the notes and thoughts you recorded relating to a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you may have discussed an idea during coffee break with a colleague. Or if you&#39;re working on a project for a client, you can use it to take note of important details, like when you expect a document, without having to create and name a document using apps like Google Docs or Evernote for each entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h3&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt; --&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;title&#34;&gt;MyChoice&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;byline&#34;&gt;Extending healthcare beyond hospital walls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/timeline.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: Due to a NDA with UPMC, I cannot reveal our findings or end solution. Here, I will focus mostly on our process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Improve patient engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a culmination of Carnegie Mellon&amp;rsquo;s Master&amp;rsquo;s of HCI program, this 8-month project was sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to look into a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the project, we conducted user research, ideated, refined and iterated our designs until we arrived at a high fidelity solution that was validated by our users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Directed Storytelling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited and interviewed over 20 patients to learn about their interactions with clinicians and the struggles they deal with day-to-day with regards to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/field-methods.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also interviewed a range of clinicians, including nurses, cardiologists and a dietician to understand the challenges they encounter trying to improve the habits of their patients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these interviews, we extracted content to build affinity diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We researched literature relating to behavior change. Among them, we came across the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change which we felt was central to our goals of understanding the barriers people have to overcome along the journey of changing their behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/behavior-model.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Diary Studies and Home Visits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gathered nine participants for a weeklong diary study. 
	Each day they answered questions about their day, for instance, what they did that made them feel happy and what stressed them. They also drew a picture to illustrate how their day went and took pictures of what they ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the homes of some of these participants to learn about the environment they lived in and what a regular day for them was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/home-visits.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Diary studies and home visits gave us an intimate understanding of the challenges that hypertension patients deal with day-to-day which ultimately helped us design a better solution&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Data Synthesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a large amount of qualitative information, we synthesized them using affinity diagrams other different modeling techniques. After completing the field discovery, we also created a hybrid flow and cultural model, personas, and customer journey models.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;From our key findings, we created personas and journey models to help the team and UPMC to better empthatize and relate to the patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/jeff-journey.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Refining 50+ visions to one idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/ideation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informed by our prior research, we generated over 50 design visions for the final product. We then refined them to 12 distinct ideas that we then developed storyboards for, in order to speed date with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/visions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback from the speed dating, we pulled the strongest features into two complete service design concepts for UPMC. After reviewing these concepts, UPMC selected the one with the strongest business value.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Prototyping: Getting from idea to validated solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the project we built four different types of prototypes to validate different aspects of our solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/prototyping.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bold&#34;&gt;Paper prototypes&lt;/span&gt; to validate the general idea and to iterate on the fly during testing with participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/paper-prototype.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bold&#34;&gt;Experience prototypes&lt;/span&gt; to validate the service. We sent SMS messages to participants when they were at appropriate times and locations to mimic a context-aware intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/woz.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bold&#34;&gt;Interactive prototypes&lt;/span&gt; to validate usability. We built a prototype using Balsamiq to learn about how patients might use the app, and the issues they would encounter as they were using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/mychoice/interactive-prototype.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bold&#34;&gt;A working prototype&lt;/span&gt; to validate prolonged usage. We built a prototype using HTML/Cordova/PhoneGap and deployed it as an Android App so that our participants could use it in real-world settings. We tracked their locations in real-time and used the Parse service to send push notifications at appropriate moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;bold&#34;&gt;A concept video&lt;/span&gt; to communicate how our solution could impact the lives of the patients we were designing for to various stakeholders, so they could envision how it would work from the perspective of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conlusion of the project, we delivered a solution to UPMC that was validated, along with all the research that led up to it so that they may further develop the product with greatly reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About UPMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is an integrated global non-profit health enterprise that has more than 62,000 employees, 22 hospitals, and a 2.2 million-member health insurance division. They are also ranked one of top ten hospitals in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-header&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;title&#34;&gt;Fluig Data&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;byline&#34;&gt;An end-to-end data exploration platform&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/fd-product-flow.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;A high level overview of Fluig Data. Data pipelines are created from various Data Sources to build Golden records, which serve as a single of truth. Following that, this records are distributed for various purposes.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/datamodel.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;In Fluig Data, data from multiple sources are mapped to Data Models, like the Customer Data Model shown here. Rules are then set up to protect the resulting Golden records from low quality data.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;About Fluig Data&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Enterprises need clean data to generate and track business metrics, but many of them tend to have business units that generate and store partial information of the same entity in siloed systems, leading to duplicate and inconsistent information. Fluig Data addresses this by centralizing all information about an entity into a Data Model, then applying rules to reject, duplicate and transform incoming data to produce a reliable single source of truth which is then used to generate insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/govern.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;After the records are processed, a dashboard gives an overview of the outcome&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;User Interface and Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Building consistent, reusable and flexible user interface patterns help to build users&#39; familiarity with the application. It also makes it easier to build new pages with a more maintainable codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;video class=&#34;&#34; autoplay controls loop&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/components.mp4&#39;&gt; 
	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Having components that are flexible, like the headers with replaceable icons, and responsive makes it easier to adapt them to support a variety of flows.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/states.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Having read&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85#.dqmcbf9y6&#34;&gt; this awesome article by Vince Speelman&lt;/a&gt;
 certainly made me consider the various states of UI in more detail.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Building a product is an extremely involved process with many levels of UI, flows, states and interactions. Each prototyping tool is suited to express a specific aspect of the design. Tools like Invision and Adobe XD are great at expressing flows, whereas others, like Framer, Origami Studio excell in expressing details in interaction and motion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;video class=&#34;&#34; autoplay controls loop poster=&#34;/assets/pensieve-poster.jpg&#34;&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/snapshots.mp4&#39;&gt; 
	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Framer is generally more suited for mobile prototypes at the moment, but one benefit it provides even for web prototypes is to be able to write logic to allow parallel flows within the same prototype.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
	&lt;video class=&#34;&#34; autoplay controls loop poster=&#34;/assets/pensieve-poster.jpg&#34;&gt;  
	   &lt;source type=&#39;video/mp4&#39; src=&#39;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/access-levels.mp4&#39;&gt; 
	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Prototyping on the web can be extremely flexible with the help of frameworks and libraries like Angular (easy two-way state binding) and Greensock, for interactivity and animation.&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://chinwei.me/assets/fluigdata/mobile.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Built in React Native, the mobile companion app allows various teams within the company to access key information about customers and other companies&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;constrain-width half-width margin-auto&#34;&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Involvement&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;As part of a team of about 15, and as one of two UX designers, I have been broadly involved in the development of Fluig Data from the beginning and in various capacities. My contributions have been mostly in the area of designing the user interface, flows and interactions, conducting interviews and usability studies, but I have touched on several other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;I initiated and conducted the first user research activities in the company, including interviews and usability studies.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Before we had a dedicated UI engineer, I built the UI on top of our framework (Angular Material at that time) and later built custom components to better flows specific to our product.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;After the release of Invision Craft&#39;s nested symbols, I re-created the UI components used in the product and centralized them using Invision Library to sync them across multiple documents and make them accessible to the team.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;I defined a standard for task specifications so that the team can have a shared understanding of the information they needed before they began working on a task.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;I convinced the team to switch over to Trello from JIRA because I wanted to make it easier and faster to create and get information about development stories.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;For a significant portion of the development, I conducted sprint planning, retrospectives and prioritized stories. Having visbility over user needs and business goals helped guide many of my decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

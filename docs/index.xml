      <description>PPM Helping retailers succeed in an Ecommerce-first world  PPM enables retailers to set and measure competitive prices.
Users of PPM (Pricing Performance Management) are merchants and pricing analysts at large retailers like Loweâ€™s or Petco. Merchants are responsible for growing the bottom-line of one or several product categories, while pricing analysts assist with creation and diagnostics of pricing strategies.
Summary I joined Boomerang soon after PPM was launched and one of my goals was to identify and address barriers to adoption.</description>

      <description>Divvy The fastest way to split bills at the table    Updates  Changed the App Bar color to white so the UI feels lighter, which also helps to surface the primary action. Added an overlay in the initial view to bring focus to the inputs when there are no items added. Moved the Add button to a position that is more reachable with the thumb. Users are now able to select who to split the price together with entering the price of the item.</description>

      <description>Pensieve Write notes and associate them with your contacts    A messaging flow should be familiar to many people. Here I am exploring to see whether it makes sense to repurpose the flow to reference people instead. Built using Sketch and Framer.  Pensieve is a place where you can write notes and associate them with people. When you take a note, it captures the date and location to help you better recall the ideas that has to do with a context and person.</description>

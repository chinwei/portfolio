Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interesting in applying for the position of [JOB POSITION] at [COMPANY]. I am currently working on an end-to-end discovery platform at TOTVS Labs, which I helped built from the ground up. Prior to this, I graduated with a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon, and in a previous life built web experiences for global brands like UPS, Allergen, Legrand and Fuji Xerox.

As part of a team at TOTVS Labs that built our product from the ground up, I have been involved in every user-facing aspect of the product. I helped define how the product works, looks and feels and took on other roles ranging from frontend development and product management. As part of a small team, I've had the opportunity to contribute in a wide variety of areas.

At TOTVS Labs, my primary contribution has been to define the UX/UI of Fluig Data. I identified the personas for various parts of the product, and validated with our features and flows. I created the design language and the UI for the product, including the typography, iconography, color palette and UI components used across the web and mobile product. To communicate with the team and stakeholders, and to validate my hypotheses with our users, I built and tested prototypes ranging from rough click-through prototypes in Invision, interactive and functional prototypes in Framer and HTML. 

At various points, I did frontend development and product management work as well. Before we had a dedicated UI developer, I implemented the UI in addition to designing them. During a phase where we didn't have a dedicated product manager, I helped gather client requirements, prioritized stories towards the goal of delivering value to our customers and achieving our product vision, and did regular check-ins with the team to ensure timely delivery.

I built my portfolio at http://chinwei.me to demonstrate the breath and depth of my work, as well as some of my aesthetic sensibilities. I hope you will find my skill set to be a relevant and worthwhile addition to your team.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Chinwei Wong

  <p>PPM enables retailers to set and measure competitive prices.</p>

  <p>Users of PPM (Pricing Performance Management) are merchants and pricing analysts at large retailers like Loweâ€™s or Petco. Merchants are responsible for growing the bottom-line of one or several product categories, while pricing analysts assist with creation and diagnostics of pricing strategies.</p>


  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>I joined Boomerang soon after PPM was launched and one of my goals was to identify and address barriers to adoption. At the time, we had some early adopters who were using the product heavily, but adoption was generally low across other customers. Through customer calls and onsite visits, we identified a number of issues which we attempted to address. Here I will talk about one of them.</p>

  <p>During this time, we also received a RFP (Request for Proposal), and needed to perform a demo for our prospect within a short time frame. The company challenged the team to address some of these usability issues and include a prototype of the alerts feature in the upcoming demo.</p>

  <h3>My Primary Role</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>User Research with merchants and pricing analysts</li>
    <li>User testing of new designs</li>
    <li>On-site visits</li>
    <li>Prototype creation</li>
    <li>Redesign of UI (for RFP)</li>
    <li>Designed UI of Alerts feature</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented utility-first SASS framework</li>
    <li>Implemented the UI redesign</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Problem</h3>

  <p>Merchants are using the product matrix frequently as part of their diagnostic workflow, but getting to it is tedious.</p>

  <p>During this time I worked on several key changes. Here I will talk about some of them relating to the product matrix. The main issues are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is a core part of many diagnostics workflows, but it is located at the end of a long page, which makes it tedious to get to.</li>
    <li>There are a number of inefficiencies in the current design. For instance, most of the cells are of little value, and the 2x2 matrix made it hard to support future opportunities which could be more fluid.</li>
    <li>The product matrix table looks extremely cluttered with data points that add little value.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="caption">Note how the product matrix is located at the end of a long page. Considering it is core part of diagnostic flows and how frequently this is accessed, its position at the bottom makes it unnecessarily tedious for users to reach.</div>

 <div class="story-block">
    <p>The product matrix is a 2x2 matrix showing how their category is distributed across revenue, split into Head (top 33%), Core (middle 33%), Tail (bottom 33%) buckets and another metric such as PPI (Price Performance Index), which is a measure of how price competitive their categories are relative to other retailers.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="img-container">
   <img src="/assets/ppm/product-matrix-cells.jpg" alt="">
 </div>

 <div class="caption">In our conversations with merchants, we learnt that while certain cells provided highly relevant and actionable information, most of the others had little value. In this example, the highlighted cell reveals that there are a large number of high-revenue products that are overpriced, possibly resulting in less than optimal sales.</div>

  <div class="story-block">

  <p>In practice, the product matrix allows a merchant to quickly identify highly visible SKUs that are priced uncompetitively. However, most of the cells were of no interest to merchants since their highest priority is to identify the worst performing SKUs since they are the ones that require urgent attention.</p>

  <h3>Constraints</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Remote engineering team in India with little time overlap</li>
    <li>Outdated code, no CSS pre-processors</li>
    <li>No HTML/CSS developer on the team</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research</h3>

  <p>We did a number of calls with some of our early adopters, and also made trips to their offices so we could meet in person to better understand the problem. One of the early issues that surfaced repeatedly from these conversations was that during the process of diagnostics, they would frequently have to access SKU level information. For instance, if they saw that the products of their category was priced much higher than on Amazon, they would want to see which of those products were responsible so they could either change the price manually or add that SKU to a pricing strategy. In our logs, we saw that SKU level access was among the most frequent action our users took, which corroborated these anecdotal evidence.</p>

  <h3>Design</h3>

  </div>

  <p>To address this issue, I proposed using a tab for users to get to the product matrix. I felt it was appropriate here because the same context is maintained across these two views, with the product matrix providing a more granular view of data. It is part of the persistent header so access to the product matrix is readily available regardless of where the user is looking at on the dashboard. The team had also been planning to add an additional view to enable root cause analysis for the merchants, so this structure would support that as well.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="caption">I brainstormed with the team on how to present a view for merchants to quickly diagnose the cause of decrease in performance, and where it could fit in the current hierarchy.</div>

  <p>For the product matrix, I proposed that we move away from a 2x2 matrix and use a list instead, since that would allow us to have more flexibility to display only what was relevant for our users. The team had been brainstorming about ways to surface advanced thematic opportunities which were more fluid, driven by data-science and wanted to present that in an upcoming demo. A list would also support that better than the current matrix.

  </div>

  <div class="caption">Before: This table has 2 different kind of values presented in each column, which makes it hard to parse and impossible to sort.</div>

  <div class="img-container">
    <img src="/assets/ppm/opportunities.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="caption">In the redesign, I reorganized the matrix into a list, and removed data points in the table which were not relevant to the current context.</div>

  <div class="story-block">

  <p>
    Lastly, the table under the product matrix looks extremely cluttered, in large part due to the number of data points forced to fit in a small area. In this arrangement, it would have been tricky to allow the user to sort by a certain value, which an interaction that many of our users would have taken for granted coming from a history of using spreadsheets in their work. The solution I proposed was to remove the data points except the ones that were relevant in the current context, which made the information much easier to parse.
  </p>

  <p>Since this was a relatively small change, we had a tight deadline and little UI engineering support, I decided to skip the wireframing and mockup stage and make the UI adjustments in code.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="caption">The alerts feature was a key differentiator for us, since it would help merchants identify the greatest risks or opportunities for growth. Being able to quickly incorporate new ideas and showcase them to our prospects put us ahead of competition.</div>

  <p>
    We were able to include these changes and also present a prototype of the alerts feature, which allow merchants to manage their categories via exceptions. Being able to demo this helped distance us from our competitors and enable the sales team to secure several landmark deals. In addition, as a result of these changes and other feature improvements, product adoption across our customers have increased significantly.</p>

  <p>Users of PPM (Pricing Performance Management) are merchants and pricing analysts at large retailers like Lowe’s or Petco. Merchants are responsible for growing the bottom-line of one or several product categories, while pricing analysts assist with creation and diagnostics of pricing strategies.</p>
  <p>PPM offers competitive price intelligence and allow pricing analysts to create create, track and diagnose strategies. </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>I joined Boomerang soon after PPM was launched and one of my goals was to identify and address barriers to adoption. Through customer calls and onsite visits, we identified a number of issues which we attempted to address. Here I will talk about one of them.</p>
  <p>During this time, we also received a RFP (Request for Proposal), and needed to do a demo within a short time frame.  The company challenged the team to address some of these usability issues and include a prototype of a new feature in the upcoming demo.</p>

  <h3>My Primary Role</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User Research with merchants and pricing analysts</li>
    <li>User testing of new designs</li>
    <li>On-site visits</li>
    <li>Prototype creation</li>
    <li>Redesign of UI (for RFP)</li>
    <li>Designed UI of Alerts feature</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented utility-first SASS framework</li>
    <li>Implemented the UI redesign</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Problem</h3>

  <p>During this time I worked on several key changes. Here I will talk about some of them relating to the product matrix. The main issues are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is a core part of many diagnostics workflows, but it is located at the end of a long page, which makes it tedious to get to.</li>
    <li>There are a number of inefficiencies in the current design. For instance, most of the cells are of little value, and the 2x2 matrix made it hard to support future opportunities which could be more fluid.</li>
    <li>The product matrix table looks extremely cluttered.</li>
  </ul>

 <div class="story-block">
    <p>The product matrix is a 2x2 matrix showing how their category is distributed across site traffic, split into Head (top 33%), Core (middle 33%), Tail (bottom 33%) buckets and another metric such as PPI (Price Performance Index) which is a measure of how price competitive their categories are relative to other retailers.</p>
 </div>

 </div>

 <div class="caption">In our conversations with merchants, we learnt that while certain cells provided highly relevant and actionable information, most of the others had little value.</div>

  <div class="story-block">

  <p>In practice, the product matrix allows a merchant to quickly identify highly visible SKUs that are priced uncompetitively. However, most of the cells were of no interest to merchants since their highest priority is to identify the worst performing SKUs since they are the ones that require urgent attention.</p>

  <h3>Constraints</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Remote engineering team in India with little time overlap</li>
    <li>Outdated code, no CSS pre-processors</li>
    <li>No HTML/CSS developer on the team</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research</h3>

  <p>We did a number of calls with some of our early adopters, and also made trips to their offices so we could meet in person to better understand the problem. One of the early issues that surfaced repeatedly from these conversations was that during the process of diagnostics, they would frequently have to access SKU level information. For instance, if they saw that the products of their category was priced much higher than on Amazon, they would want to see which of those products were responsible so they could either change the price manually or add that SKU to a pricing strategy. In our logs, we saw that SKU level access was among the most frequent action our users took, which corroborated these anecdotal evidence.</p>

  <div class="story-block">
  <h3>Design</h3>

  <p>Seeing that access to SKU level information is so frequent, and that it is a core part of many diagnostics workflow, I felt that we should present it as a different layer of information, rather than as a widget at the end of the dashboard. Also, the product matrix had different modes and filters which required some level of user action to extract value, and I felt it detracted from the intent of a dashboard.</p>

  <p>Therefore, I proposed that the product matrix be presented as a different view since it is looking at a different level of information, and access to it should be in the persistent header so it can be accessed regardless of where the user is looking at in the dashboard. Later on, the team also talked about providing another view for root cause analysis, so this structure also made sense in retrospect.</p>

  <div class="caption">I brainstormed with the team on how to present a view for merchants quickly diagnose the cause of decrease in performance, and where it could fit in the current hierarchy.</div>

  <div class="story-block">

  <p>For the product matrix, I proposed that we move away from a 2x2 matrix and use a list instead, since that would allow us to have more flexibility to display only what was relevant for our users.  Co-incidentally, the team had been brainstorming about ways to surface advanced thematic opportunities  driven by data-science and wanted to present that in an upcoming demo, so there seemed to be an opportunity to satisfy both needs. I also took the chance to simplify the table. Previously the table contained a large number of data points, some of which were not necessary and resulted in an extremely cluttered-looking table.</p>

  <div class="caption">In the redesigned product matrix, I reorganized the matrix into a list, and removed data points in the table which were not relevant to the current context.</div>

  <div class="caption">Note how the product matrix is located at the end of a long page. Considering it is core part of diagnostic flows and how frequently this is accessed, its position at the bottom makes it unnecessarily tedious for users to reach.</div>

  <div class="story-block">

  <p>Since this was a relatively small change, we had a tight deadline and little UI engineering support, I decided to skip the wireframing and mockup stage and make the UI adjustments in code.</p>

  <p>We were able to include these changes and also present a prototype of the alerts feature in the demo, which was received extremely favorably. Subsequently, the team won Boomerang’s first RFP with US’s largest retailer, a significant milestone for a company at this stage. Following the rollout of these improvements, we reached out to our users during our routine update call and received generally positive feedback about the UI improvements.</p>

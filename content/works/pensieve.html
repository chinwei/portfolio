<p>With Pensieve, you can record pieces of information about during informal interactions and because your notes live on a timeline, it is easy to look back at the notes and thoughts you recorded relating to a person. </p>

<p>For instance, you may have discussed an idea during coffee break with a colleague. Or if you're working on a project for a client, you can use it to take note of important details, like when you expect a document, without having to create and name a document using apps like Google Docs or Evernote for each entry.</p>

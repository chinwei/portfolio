Divvy is a quick, no frills way of splitting bills with friends at the table. 

No need to get all your friends to sign up for an account just so you can split a bill. Divvy works on the device, so it is always quickly accessible.

Skip the naming. Mentally associate an animal to each friend you are chilling out with (temporarily!) for a more streamlined and enjoyable flow.

This is an ongoing personal project that I am doing for fun. Do reach out if you would like to provide feedback, or want to help out!

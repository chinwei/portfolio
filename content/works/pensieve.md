<span class="byline">Context Aware Diary</span>

Moment is an attempt to capture small pieces of information during informal interactions. Many kinds of information, like learning something interesting during a coffee meeting with a colleague not easily captured. 

What if capturing a thought was as simple as sending a message to yourself, and what if it was as easy to associate that note with people, location and documents?

The idea for Moment came about when I realized how cumbersome it was to have to name each note in apps like Evernote or Google Docs.

Another drawback of organizing notes around documents was that it made it harder to link between them.

Reminders but not todos, no due date

- Had meeting with A and B today, decided to go with X

- X mentioned that his boss prefers this, should explore in that direction

Pensieve is a place where you can write notes and associate them with people. When you take a note, it captures the date and location to help you better recall the ideas that has to do with a context and person.

With Pensieve, you can record pieces of information during informal interactions, like an idea during coffee break with a colleague. Or if you're working on a project for a client, you can use it to take note of important things, like when you expect a document, without having to create and name a document on Google Drive for each interaction.

Because your notes live on a timeline, it is super easy to look back at the notes and thoughts relating to a person.

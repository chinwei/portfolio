<h3>Improve patient engagement</h3>

<p>As a culmination of Carnegie Mellon’s Master’s of HCI program, this 8-month project was sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to look into a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes.</p> 

<h3>Approach</h3> 

<p>Over the course of the project, we conducted user research, ideated, refined and iterated our designs until we arrived at a high fidelity solution that was validated by our users.</p>

<p>During the research phase of the project, we studied patient lives, behavior change strategies, spoke with clinicians, and developed key insights which informed our ideas toward this goal.</p>

<p>Following that, we validated our ideas with our users, by getting them to interact with prototypes of increasing fidelity. At the end of the prototyping phase, we built a mobile app prototype using PhoneGap and Cordova that could track the location of our users.</p>

>Note: Due to a NDA with UPMC, I cannot reveal our findings or end solution. Here, I will focus mostly on our process.

### Improve patient engagement

As a culmination of Carnegie Mellon’s Master’s of HCI program, this 8-month project was sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to look into a patient-facing tool with the goals of deeper engagement with the health system and better health outcomes. 

### Approach 

Over the course of the project, we conducted user research, ideated, refined and iterated our designs until we arrived at a high fidelity solution that was validated by our users.

During the research phase of the project, we studied patient lives, behavior change strategies, spoke with clinicians, and developed key insights which informed our ideas toward this goal. 

Following that, we validated our ideas with our users, by getting them to interact with prototypes of increasing fidelity. At the end of the prototyping phase, we built a mobile app prototype using PhoneGap and Cordova that could track the location of our users.

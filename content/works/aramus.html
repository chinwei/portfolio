  <p>After spending a few months on PPM, the team wanted to invest more resources in a new product and enter a new market. I was assigned to be part of this team.</p>

  <p>The team needed someone to help iterate quickly and build prototypes to show to prospects. The company’s strategy was to go into meetings and presenting a realistic demo, and iterate based on how the prospect responded.</p>

  <h3>Design</h3>

  <p>Given that we needed to present an approach to even prospects, the sales and product team came up with a list of features and handed it to me to execute.</p>

  <p>It was a large scope, so I started with to do some UI components that I knew would be used. In PPM, I had already started thinking about a future UI redesign so I built on top of those components.</p>

  <p>There weren’t many opportunities to validate the designs, since we needed to present what appears to be a working product from the get-go. However, we did hire some Amazon consultants in the space to talk to and validated the general approach.</p>

  <p>Given that this is an MVP, there was pressure to cover a lot of ground over a short period of time, and I also didn’t want to commit too much time refining the UI before we had real users to iterate with since then we’d just be acting based on our assumptions. So as much possible I kept to simple and familiar patterns. For instance, in the initial cut of the alerts feature, I proposed an design and interaction pattern similar to email, since we hypothesized that each day our users would look at the most important alerts and act on them.</p>

  <p>Originally, the focus was on sales operations, but with the recent launch of Amazon’s AMS API, I was reassigned to look at Ad Advertising use cases.</p>

  <p>Originally, AMS was conceived as a stand-alone product, so I talked to an internal Amazon sales specialist who used to work at an Amazon consultancy managing campaigns for his clients.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the team decided that the Ad Automation should be a module within the original product, so we could scale it to include more modules in the future.</p>

  <h3>Implementation</h3>

  <p>Reporting and dashboards are an important part of the product and the demo, and we needed to have custom and convincing data for most demo, and the sales team was doing multiple demos in a week. If we were to populate the data the way we did for PPM, there would have been no way to finish the population in time, especially considering the entire engineering team is located in India.</p>

  <p>This demo contained a lot of data, which increased as the sales team wanted to test more ideas. There were also many demo meetings, In order to populate the data for many demos.  </p>

  <p>I learnt from PPM, demos required backend help. The sales and PM would print out the screenshots, draw over the charts and write the values in hand and send it to the engineering team in India. Sometimes, some of the instructions were mis-interpreted and it would take several days to get something ready for a demo.</p>

  <p>Therefore right from the beginning, I proposed that we should build in the functionality for each demo data to be populated by the sales team. This way, the sales team would have full control over the data that was presented in the demo, and they would be able to make immediate tweaks.</p>

  <h3>Boomerang UI library</h3>

  <p>The team also didn’t have anyone with a background in writing scalable markup and CSS. I advocated for a UI library so that developers could use the component as defined while I still had full control over the components. I partnered with a developer to build a rough but working documentation. However, building a component library system is not a trivial task, and what we did in the end was to clone the Buefy library, and modify and replace the components.</p>

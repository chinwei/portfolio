  <p>Aramus is Boomerang’s first foray into Ad and Operations automation on Amazon. Being the lead designer on this project, I conducted interviews to validate our hypotheses via wireframes, mocks and prototypes, synthesized learnings and collaborated with the engineers to deliver on the UI for our MVP. The following are some of the ideas I developed with the team during the process.</p>

<h3>Ecommerce has changed the way consumers buy</h3>

<p>
  Earlier consumers discovered products through TV advertisements, relied on the look and feel of the product to make a purchasing decision, and were generally loyal to brands. Today, millions of consumers discover products daily via online search, rely on reviews and content to make a purchasing decision.
</p>

<p>This has forced brands to move away from traditional models which involved relationship selling into a real time competition for online keywords and optimizations.</p>

<h3>Tools need to evolve to be Ecommerce-first too</h3>

<p>
    This necessitates an evolution in the tools. In order to support this new mode of operation. Merchants need tools that can help them process billions of data points, predict risks and growth opportunities and help make decisions in real time.

<div class="caption">Ecommerce merchants often deal with questions that span across multiple dimensions. This multi-variate filter allow merchants to ask questions like: Which are my largest campaigns that are also the most inefficient?</div>

<div class="story-block">

<p>
    Merchants manage up to hundreds of campaigns and thousands of keywords daily, and they continuously have to make sure their products are surfaced via appropriate keywords in a rapidly changing environment, and have to continually optimize their spend and capture opportunities.

<p>
    Automation has the potential to help merchants identify opportunities and take action. Machines can process billions of data points daily, which not only allow them to identify competitive threats and opportunities in advance of their human counterparts, but also to take actions to drive the merchant’s business goals.

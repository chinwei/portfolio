	<p>As part of a team that built this product from the ground up, I have been involved in every user-facing aspect of the product. I helped define how the product works, looks and feels and took on other roles ranging from frontend developement and product management.</p>

		<h3>Designing for People</h3>
		<p>Understanding the motivations of each persona and how they interact with the product is crucial. I architected the overall flow of the product with these considerations in mind</p>

		<h3>Cohesive Design Language</h3>
		<p>A cohesive design language gives the product a consistent look and feel, and makes it easier to identify cues. I created a design system with an emphasis on neutrality and conciseness to minimize friction to information access.</p>

		<h3>Flexible Layouts</h3>
		<p>With the goal of promoting users' familarity and reducing the learning curve of the product, the various layouts in the product are designed to structurally familiar yet flexible enough to cater to a variety of use case.</p>

		<h3>Visual Clarity</h3>
		<p>For a data-centric interface, managing information clutter and keeping complex controls accessible is a constant challenge. Visually, I employed generous use of white space and sparing use of colors to convey a sense of order and visual hierarchy.</p>

		<h3>Reusable and Compostable Elements</h3>
		<p>in order to build usersâ€™ familarity with the product, i strived to use consistent UI and interaction patterns. The UI is also designed to be compostable within other components for maximum reuse.</p>

		<h3>Prototyping from Paper to Pixels</h3>

	<h3>Involvement</h3>

	<p>As part of a team of about 15, and as one of two UX designers, I have been broadly involved in the development of Fluig Data from the beginning and in various capacities. My contributions have been mostly in the area of designing the user interface, flows and interactions, conducting interviews and usability studies, but I have touched on several other areas as well.</p>

	<p>Some highlights:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I initiated and conducted the first user research activities in the company, including interviews and usability studies.</li>
		<li>Before we had a dedicated UI engineer, I built the UI on top of our framework (Angular Material at that time) and later built custom components to better flows specific to our product.</li>
		<li>After the release of Invision Craft's nested symbols, I re-created the UI components used in the product and centralized them using Invision Library to sync them across multiple documents and make them accessible to the team.</li>
		<li>I defined a standard for task specifications so that the team can have a shared understanding of the information they needed before they began working on a task.</li>
		<li>I convinced the team to switch over to Trello from JIRA because I wanted to make it easier and faster to create and get information about development stories.</li>
		<li>For a significant portion of the development, I conducted sprint planning, retrospectives and prioritized stories. Having visbility over user needs and business goals helped guide many of my decisions.</li>
	</ul>

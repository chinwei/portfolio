	<p>Large enterprises use multiple software to store different parts of information about people, products and other entities. Most of these software are not interconnected which makes assembling a complete picture difficult.</p>

	<p>Fluig Data allows analysts, operational staff and business leaders in an organization to access information about their customers and products on demand and generate dashboards to track performance metrics.</p>

	<p>Having clean, accurate data is a prerequisite to having meaningful and actionable insights. Fluig Data makes it easy to onboard data sources via connectors to internal and public data sources. It structures, normalizes, cleanses and validates the data to create a reliable source of truth for an record.</p>

	<p>As part of a small team of about 15, and with only two UX designers,  I have been broadly involved in the development of Fluig Data from the beginning and in varying capacities. My contributions have been mostly in the area of designing the user interface, flows and interactions, conducting interviews and usability studies, but I have touched on several other areas as well.</p>

	<p>Some highlights:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I initiated and conducted the first user research activities in the company, including interviews and usability studies.</li>
		<li>Before we had a dedicated UI engineer, I built the UI on top of our framework (Angular Material at that time) and later built custom components to better flows specific to our product.</li>
		<li>After the release of Invision Craft's nested symbols, I re-created the UI components used in the product and centralized them using Invision Library to sync them across multiple documents and make them accessible to the team.</li>
		<li>I defined a standard for task specifications so that the team can have a shared understanding of the information they needed before they began working on a task.</li>
		<li>I convinced the team to switch over to Trello from JIRA because I wanted to make it easier and faster to create and get information about development stories.</li>
		<li>For a significant portion of the development, I conducted sprint planning, retrospectives and prioritized stories. Having visbility over user needs and business goals helped guide many of my decisions.</li>

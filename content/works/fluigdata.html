	<p>As part of a team that built this product from the ground up, I have been involved in every user-facing aspect of the product. I helped define how the product works, looks and feels and took on other roles ranging from frontend developement and product management.</p>

		<h3>Designing for People</h3>
		<p>Understanding the motivations of each persona and how they interact with the product is crucial. I architected the overall flow of the product with these considerations in mind</p>

		<h3>Cohesive Design Language</h3>
		<p>A cohesive design language gives the product a consistent look and feel, and makes the user interface easier to navigate. I created a design system that is neutral and unobtrusive so that crucial information is more easily surfaced.</p>

		<h3>Flexible Layouts</h3>
		<p>In order to promote users' familarity and to minimize the learning curve of the product, I designed the layouts in the product to be structurally familiar yet flexible enough to cater to a variety of use cases.</p>

		<h3>Visual Clarity</h3>
		<p>Managing clutter for a complex data-centric interface is a constant challenge. I addressed it with the sparing use of colors, and being disciplined about only showing relevant information at a given time.</p>

		<h3>Cross-Platform Consistency</h3>

		<h3>Re-usable and Compostable Elements</h3>
		<p>In order to build usersâ€™ familarity with the product, I strived to use consistent UI and interaction patterns. The UI is also designed to be compostable within other elements for maximum re-use.

		<h3>Prototyping from Paper to Pixels</h3>
		<p>Prototypes are essential from getting feedback from other designers, engineers, product managers, stakeholders and users. I prototyped across the range of fidelities, ranging from click-through prototypes in Invision, interactive and functional prototypes in Framer and HTML.

<div class="constrain-width half-width margin-auto">
	<p>Divvy is a quick, no frills way of splitting bills with friends at the table. </p>
	<p>No need to get all your friends to sign up for an account just so you can split a bill. Divvy works on the device, so it is always quickly accessible.</p>
	<p>Skip the naming. Mentally associate an animal to each friend you are chilling out with (temporarily!) for a more streamlined and enjoyable flow.</p>
	<p>This is an ongoing personal project that I am doing for fun. Do reach out if you would like to provide feedback, or want to help out!</p>
